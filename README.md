# Cybersecurity
Hello, my name is Mauricio Vigo Lavalle. I have a technical degree in System Administration and Networking, and I'm currently pursuing a Technical Master's Degree in Cybersecurity. 
I will be posting write-ups of some virtual machines I manage to penetrate and other things related to cybersecurity. Keep in mind that I am still learning, so if you find any mistakes, please feel free to let me know.

If you have any specific questions or if there's anything else you'd like assistance with, feel free to ask!


<code>Thanks</code>
